N E M E S I S  -  TCP/IP Packet Injection
=========================================
[![Travis Status][]][Travis] [![Coverity Status]][Coverity Scan] <img align="right" src="logo.png">

The Nemesis Project is designed to be a command line based, portable
human IP stack for UNIX-like and Windows systems.  The suite is broken
down by protocol, and should allow for useful scripting of injected
packets from simple shell scripts.


Key Features
------------

* ARP/RARP, DNS, ETHERNET, ICMP, IGMP, IP, OSPF, RIP, TCP and UDP
  protocol support
* Layer 2 or Layer 3 injection on UNIX-like systems
* Layer 2 injection (only) on Windows systems
* Packet payload from file
* IP and TCP options from file
* Tested on OpenBSD, Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X and Windows 2000

Each supported protocol uses its own protocol "injector" which is
accompanied by a man page explaining its functionality.

Consult the ChangeLog for release details, and the documentation for
each protocol injector for in-depth descriptions of the available
functionality.


Examples
--------

* Inject malformed ICMP redirect

        sudo nemesis icmp -S 10.10.10.3 -D 10.10.10.1 -G 10.10.10.3 -i 5

* IGMP v2 join for group 239.186.39.5

        sudo nemesis igmp -v -p 22 -S 192.168.1.20 -i 239.186.39.5 -D 239.186.39.5

* IGMP v2 query, max resp. time 10 sec, with Router Alert IP option

        echo -ne '\x94\x04\x00\x00' >RA
        sudo nemesis igmp -v -p 0x11 -c 100 -D 224.0.0.1 -O RA

  or

        echo -ne '\x94\x04\x00\x00' | sudo nemesis igmp -v -p 0x11 -c 100 -D 224.0.0.1 -O -

* IGMP v3 query, with Router Alert IP option

        echo -ne '\x03\x64\x00\x00' > v3
        sudo nemesis igmp -p 0x11 -c 100 -i 0.0.0.0 -P v3 -D 224.0.0.1 -O v3

* Random TCP packet

        sudo nemesis tcp

* DoS and DDoS testing

        sudo nemesis tcp -v -S 192.168.1.1 -D 192.168.2.2 -fSA -y 22 -P foo
        sudo nemesis udp -v -S 10.11.12.13 -D 10.1.1.2 -x 11111 -y 53 -P bindpkt
        sudo nemesis icmp redirect -S 10.10.10.3 -D 10.10.10.1 -G 10.10.10.3 -qR
        sudo nemesis arp -v -d ne0 -H 0:1:2:3:4:5 -S 10.11.30.5 -D 10.10.15.1


Build & Install
---------------

Nemesis is built around [libnet][].  Windows platform builds require
[libpcap][] as well.  On Debian and Ubuntu derived GNU/Linux systems:

    sudo apt install libnet1-dev

The [GNU Configure & Build][buildsystem] system use `/usr/local` as the
default install prefix.  Usually this is sufficient, the below example
installs to `/usr` instead:

    tar xf nemesis-1.5.tar.xz
	cd nemesis-1.5/
    ./configure --prefix=/usr
    make -j5
    sudo make install-strip


Building from GIT
-----------------

If you want to contribute, or simply want to try out the latest but
still unreleased features, then you need to know a few things about
the [GNU Configure & Build][buildsystem] system:

- `configure.ac` and a per-directory `Makefile.am` are key files
- `configure` and `Makefile.in` are generated from `autogen.sh`,
  they are not stored in GIT but automatically generated for the
  release tarballs
- `Makefile` is generated by `configure` script

To build from GIT you first need to clone the repository and run the
`autogen.sh` script.  This requires `automake` and `autoconf` to be
installed on your system.

    git clone https://github.com/troglobit/inadyn.git
    cd inadyn/
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure && make

GIT sources are a moving target and are not recommended for production
systems, unless you know what you are doing!
